## MNIST Model Demo: Understanding Feed-forward Networks

Using the renowned MNIST dataset, the `feed_forward_mnist` demonstration provides a tangible example of how feed-forward
networks operate:

- Download and introduction to the MNIST dataset.
- Explaining the significance of data transformations.
- Selection and visualization of sample data.
- Step-by-step construction of a `FeedForwardNetwork`.
- Integration and interpretation of pre-trained model weights.
- Insightful visualization showcasing predictions and overall model accuracy.
